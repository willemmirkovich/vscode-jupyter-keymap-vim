# Jupyter Vim Keymap

This is an extension to incorporate common [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) keymaps while editing 
jupyter notebooks in VSCode. 

Meant to work alongside the great extension that allows you to edit jupyter 
notebooks in VSCode [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)

This extension is intended to be used alongside the other great extension [VSCode Vim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim)

Keymaps inspired by [jupyter-vim-binding](https://github.com/lambdalisue/jupyter-vim-binding)
